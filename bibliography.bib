  abstract = {This paper presents the open-source high-level synthesis (HLS) research 
              framework Bambu. Bambu provides a research environment to experiment with 
              new ideas across HLS, high-level verification and debugging, FPGA/ASIC design,
              design flow space exploration, and parallel hardware accelerator design. The 
              tool accepts as input standard C/C++ specifications and compiler intermediate 
              representations (IRs) coming from the well-known Clang/LLVM and GCC compilers. 
              The broad spectrum and flexibility of input formats allow the electronic 
              design automation (EDA) research community to explore and integrate new 
              transformations and optimizations. The easily extendable modular framework 
              already includes many optimizations and HLS benchmarks used to evaluate 
              the QoR of the tool against existing approaches [1]. The integration with 
              synthesis and verification backends (commercial and open-source) allows 
              researchers to quickly test any new finding and easily obtain performance 
              and resource usage metrics for a given application. Different FPGA devices 
              are supported from several different vendors: AMD/Xilinx, Intel/Altera, 
              Lattice Semiconductor, and NanoXplore. Finally, integration with the OpenRoad 
              open-source end-to-end silicon compiler perfectly fits with the recent push 
              towards open-source EDA.},
